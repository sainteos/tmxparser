# tmxparser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmxparser/tmxparser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/m-waka/tmxparser)

This is a C++11 library for parsing the maps generated by
[Tiled Map Editor](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/).

The TMX format is based upon XML and may contain compressed and encoded tile
data to save memory and reduce file sizes. This parser uses the
[TinyXML2](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/) library and its DOM interface
to parse TMX files.

An example file is provided to understand how to use the library.

## Features

 * Conformity with the [TMX specification page](http://doc.mapeditor.org/en/latest/reference/tmx-map-format/). (Current Version Support is 1.0)
 * Decodes and decompresses tile data.
 * Can parse properties as integers, real numbers, and literals (strings).
 * Can parse the map file when stored in memory.
 * Does not rely on any graphics library.
 * Animated tile support.
 * Group Layer support.

## Dependencies

 * zlib
 * TinyXML2 >= 6.0.0
